Iteration 3: 
Report

For this iteration a new page on plant toxicity was added as well as a page for plants with flowers.
These pages show the user plants based on their toxicity as well as their flower color.
Questions have also been added to the search option, this will allow the user to find more specific plants that meet their interests.
The water intake and sunlight intake pages have also been updated and completed.
Lastly, the plant activity pages have been recreated.  This was necessary due to display errors.

For this iteration, Jason Ford created new questions and pages for the search as well as implemented the test cases.
Jason also used Lint to look for code mistakes and optimize the code. Deleted some imports that were not needed, and classes that
were old. Did not take some of the suggestions of changing spelling and changing button names. Didn't want to break any links.

Suzanne Prince completed the water intake feature and recreated plant activities that didn’t work.
Regan Zhou completed the sunlight intake feature and recreated a few plant activity pages as well.
Rebecca Culpepper created a toxicity page and a flower page, she also helped with recreating plant activities.
All team members also worked on debugging through-out this iteration.

Iteration 2:

Suzanne Prince actually did plant pages commit not Regan Zhou.  
Suzanne worked on plant pages, identifier, adding information to sunlight and water intake pages

Ford worked on identifier and plant pages. Test cases.

Rebecca worked on test cases and plant pages bug fixes "algorithm" plant information.

Regan plant pages, sun intake pages, video

Difficulties in getting xml pages to work properly with the code to show plants after proper button clicks, plant identification
complexity got too much after a while.


Iteration 1:

Built skeleton of program to be filled in later once plant research complete.

Difficulty in getting started on what to do.
